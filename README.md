This is very easy to follow and illustrates a very simple "microservices" example using docker-compose to orchestrate the containers.
The code is basically the end state of the videos so you can follow and execute as he goes along.

In the example he creates a small application with two "microservices" (written in different languages - one in php, one in python...that's a cool thing about microservices) - then he builds and deploys them in one step using docker compose.

1. Download the project to somewhere on the filesystem - there is no need to compile or build anything, no maven project, no classpath

>git clone https://github.com/mattua/docker-hello.git

2. cd into docker-hello folder

3. Just follow the video from there - all the source and docker files are in place already...there is no need to edit anything to make it work
